Due to Firefox limitations, a very small amount of data needs to be web-hosted in order for custom search engines to be created.

The user data which is used is as follows:
* The name that is provided for a custom search engine
* The description that is provided for a custom search engine
* The URL of the site which a search engine is being created for

This data is sent to https://paste.mozilla.org for hosting. The data is deleted after 1 hour, so nothing is stored.

No data beyond the above is collected.

Mozilla's privacy policies apply to https://paste.mozilla.org, and the extension author takes no responsibility for the
